This repository showcases all the files Prisma 2 is able to generate from the
Prisma DSL definition in `schema.prisma`.

The instructions for understanding the generation steps are described in the
"[Start from scratch (Prisma Migrate)](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch-prisma-migrate-typescript-postgres)"
guide.

The script for generating the TypeScript typings and the GraphQL schema can be
found
[here](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma/issues/339#issuecomment-609782477).
